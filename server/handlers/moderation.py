"""
In-game moderation: g2_moderatorBanAccount / g2_moderatorWarnAccount.

The client's mod menu calls these on the server, but every player has the
`moderator` role from the default loadout, so WITHOUT a gate any player could
ban anyone. We only apply a ban/warn when the acting account is real staff
(MOD_STAFF allowlist); everyone else gets a silent no-op success.

A ban sets `adminBlocked` (the existing block switch login.py already serves as
permabanned+isolated) plus `banExpireTimestamp` for timed bans (login
auto-clears it when it passes). A warn sets `hasPendingWarning` + `warnReason`,
which login serves once then clears.
