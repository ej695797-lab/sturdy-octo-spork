"""
Role-locked patterns: special blocks only accounts with a given server-only role
may own (and therefore place). Applied to every place the client reads its
account: the login reply (handlers/login.py) and DynamoDB G2_Accounts reads
(services/dynamo_ops.py). Server-only roles aren't game roles, so they are
stripped from the roleKeys the client sees.

Grant: add the role to the account's roleKeys (editor / Mongo), e.g. "blaze".
