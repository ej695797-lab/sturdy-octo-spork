"""
Per-headset device keys: proof of WHO is making a request.

The game API has no player login of its own (requests only carry an accountID).
From build 131b14 the client puts a device key in every API URL, /k/<64 hex>/...
(sha256 of the headset's Android ID: stable across reinstalls, different per
headset, never sent raw). main.py strips it into request.state.device_key.

Binding: the first login of an account from a key binds that key to the account,
but only from an IP the account has logged in from before (lastIP/recentIPs) or
for a brand-new account. Someone who merely knows an accountID can't claim it:
they can't send from the owner's IP through Cloudflare. After binding, requests
for that account must carry one of its bound keys. An admin can clear an
account's keys in the editor (new headset / factory reset).

DEVICE_AUTH env: "observe" (default) binds and logs but never blocks - used while
players move to the new build; "enforce" blocks. Keys are stored peppered +
hashed, so a database leak doesn't hand out usable keys.
